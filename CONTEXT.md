NamFix is a tradesperson directory & booking platform for Namibia. Clients find and pay skilled
providers (plumbers, electricians, mechanics, …); the platform earns a **commission on each
transaction** processed through it.

---

## 1. Solution structure & responsibilities

```
NamFix.sln
├── NamFix.Shared        Class lib  — DTOs, domain models, enums, contracts/interfaces. No dependencies.
├── NamFix.Application   Class lib  — business logic + Dapper data access. Depends on Shared.
├── NamFix.SharedUi      Razor RCL  — ALL reusable Blazor UI (pages, layout, components, API client,
│                                     map/geolocation). Depends on Shared.
├── NamFix.Web           Blazor WASM— standalone front-end host. Depends on SharedUi + Shared.
├── NamFix.Api           ASP.NET API— Web API backend (REST + SignalR) only. Depends on Application,
│                                     Shared. Does NOT reference or host Web.
└── NamFix.Mobile        .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid (Android) — hosts the SharedUi RCL in a BlazorWebView.
                         Depends on SharedUi + Shared. In the solution (needs the maui-android workload). See its README.
```

### Dependency direction (arrows point to the dependency)

```
NamFix.Api  ──►  NamFix.Application  ──►  NamFix.Shared
                                             ▲
        NamFix.Web  ──►  NamFix.SharedUi  ───┘
```

`Shared` is the leaf everything points at. `Api` and `Web` are fully decoupled — they share no
project reference. UI never references `Application`; it only talks to the API over HTTP via
`NamFixApiClient`.

> **API and client are separate deployables.** `NamFix.Api` is a pure backend (REST + SignalR); it
> does not host the client. `NamFix.Web` is served on its own (its dev server locally; a static host
> in production) and reaches the API cross-origin via `ApiBaseUrl` (`wwwroot/appsettings.json`), so
> the API's `Cors:Origins` allowlist is load-bearing — keep it in sync with where the client runs.

---

## 3. Database conventions

SQL lives in `NamFix.Api/Migrations/` and is run by Grate. See `NamFix.Api/Migrations/README.md` for the run order table and exact command.

- **`Migrations/up/`** — versioned, run-**once** schema. Files are sequentially numbered
  (`0001_create_users.sql`, …). Tables, indexes, FKs, and the full-text catalog/index live here.
- **`Migrations/views/`** — `CREATE OR ALTER VIEW`, re-run any time the file changes.
- **`Migrations/sprocs/`** — `CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE`, re-run any time changed (e.g. `usp_ProviderTypeahead`).
- **`Migrations/permissions/`** — grants, run every time (guarded/idempotent).
- **`Migrations/seed/`** — reference + sample data, run every time, **idempotent** (`MERGE` / `IF NOT EXISTS`).
- **`Migrations/runAfterCreateDatabase/`** — one-time setup right after the DB is created.

**Naming:** PascalCase tables/columns; PK `PK_<Table>`, FK `FK_<Table>_<Ref>`, unique `UX_…`, index `IX_…`.
Enums are stored as `INT` columns (see `NamFix.Shared.Enums`).

**Full-text setup:** catalog `NamFixCatalog`; full-text index on
`dbo.Providers(BusinessName, Description, SearchKeywords)` keyed by `PK_Providers`. `SearchKeywords`
is a **denormalized blob** (business name + category + tags) maintained by `ProviderService` on save,
so tag/category terms are searchable without joins. Search uses `FREETEXT` for natural-language,
inflection-tolerant matching.

**Typo/spacing-tolerant matching** (`NamFix.Application/Search`): full-text alone can't forgive
misspellings or wrong spacing ("NamibBuild"→"Namib Build", "Namb B"→"Namib Build"). `FuzzyMatcher`
(normalization + token-coverage + bounded Levenshtein) scores queries over a small cached in-memory
index of active providers (`IProviderSearchIndex`, `IMemoryCache`, 60s TTL, invalidated on provider
save). It powers two things: the search-box **typeahead** dropdown (`GET api/search/typeahead`) and a
**recall boost** on full search — `ProviderService.SearchAsync` OR's the fuzzy-matched ids into the
SQL `FREETEXT` predicate so misspelled/odd-spaced queries still return the full result grid. The
legacy `usp_ProviderTypeahead` sproc is superseded by this in-app path.

---

## 4. Auth approach

- Registration picks a role (`Client`, `ServiceProvider`, `Admin`) up front (low-friction onboarding).
- Passwords hashed with **PBKDF2-SHA256** (`PasswordHasher`), format `{iterations}.{salt}.{key}`.
- Login/refresh issue a **JWT access token** (short-lived) + an opaque **refresh token** (DB-stored,
  rotated on use, revocable). See `AuthService` and `JwtTokenService`.
- The API validates JWTs via `AddJwtBearer`; controllers authorize by role
  (`[Authorize(Roles = nameof(UserRole.Admin))]`, etc.).
- **Token storage is behind `ITokenStore`** — web uses `localStorage` (`LocalStorageTokenStore`),
  MAUI will use SecureStorage. The Blazor auth state is rebuilt from the JWT by
  `NamFixAuthStateProvider`; `AuthHeaderHandler` attaches the bearer token to API calls.
- The signing key may come from config or a `NAMFIX_`-prefixed env var (e.g. `NAMFIX_Jwt__SigningKey`).
  The **database connection string is read exclusively from `appsettings.json`**
  (`ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection`) and cannot be overridden by an environment variable.

---

## 5. UI-sharing strategy (web now, MAUI later)

- **Every routable page, layout, and component lives in `NamFix.SharedUi`** (a Razor Class Library),
  along with the typed `NamFixApiClient`, auth state provider, and map/geolocation services.
- `NamFix.Web` is a thin host: its `App.razor` pulls the RCL routes in via
  `AdditionalAssemblies`, and `index.html` loads Leaflet + the RCL's `namfix.css`.
- `NamFix.Mobile` (MAUI Blazor Hybrid, Android) renders the same RCL inside a `BlazorWebView`. Its
  `MauiProgram.cs` calls `AddNamFixSharedUi()` and `Components/Routes.razor` pulls the routes in via
  `AdditionalAssemblies` — same pattern as `NamFix.Web`. Only platform-specific implementations differ
  (`ITokenStore` → `SecureStorageTokenStore`; API base URL in `MobileConfig.cs`). See its README.

---

## 6. Platform abstractions (in `NamFix.Shared.Contracts`)

| Interface              | Web implementation (where)                         | MAUI implementation (later) |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `IMapService`          | `LeafletMapService` (SharedUi, JS interop)         | reused as-is (BlazorWebView) |
| `IGeolocationService`  | `BrowserGeolocationService` (SharedUi)             | reused as-is                 |
| `ITokenStore`          | `LocalStorageTokenStore` (**NamFix.Web**)          | `SecureStorageTokenStore` (**NamFix.Mobile**) |
| `ISecureStorage`       | (not yet needed)                                   | MAUI SecureStorage           |
| `IPaymentService`      | `StubPaymentService` (**NamFix.Application**)       | DPO / PayToday / bank EFT    |

Anything genuinely host-specific (token storage, future file pickers / push) is registered by the
host; host-agnostic services (map, geolocation, API client, auth state) are registered by
`AddNamFixSharedUi()`.

## 7. Monetization — transaction commission

Revenue is a **configurable percentage commission per transaction** (not subscriptions).

**Flow** (`TransactionService.CreateAsync`):
1. Resolve the effective rate via `CommissionRepository.ResolveRateAsync` — most specific active rule
   wins: **Provider override > Category override > Platform default** (`CommissionRules` table,
   `CommissionScope` enum). Default platform rate is seeded at 10%.
2. `CommissionAmount = round(Gross × Rate)`, `NetPayout = Gross − Commission`.
3. `IPaymentService.HoldAsync` holds the gross from the client → status **Held** (commission captured).
4. `PayoutAsync` later releases `NetPayout` to the provider → status **PaidOut**.
   This **hold-then-release** pattern guarantees commission is secured before payout.

**Transaction data model** (`Transactions` table / `Transaction` entity): gross amount, commission
rate applied, commission amount, net payout, status (`Pending/Held/PaidOut/Refunded/Failed`),
currency (NAD), payment reference, and `Created/Held/PaidOut` timestamps.

**Reporting:** admins get period revenue totals sliced **by category and by town**
(`AdminController.Revenue` → `TransactionRepository.GetRevenueReportAsync`); providers get a
gross / commission / net / pending earnings rollup (`TransactionsController.Earnings`).

Featured/promoted listings are an optional *secondary* stream and are not the primary model.

## 8. Running locally

**Prerequisites:** .NET 10 SDK, SQL Server (LocalDB / Express / full), Grate (`dotnet tool install -g grate`).

```bash
# 1. Apply schema + seed (see NamFix.Api/Migrations/README.md for the full --folders command and caveats)
grate --connectionstring="Server=localhost;Database=NamFix;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;" \
      --sqlfilesdirectory=./NamFix.Api/Migrations --databasetype=sqlserver \
      --folders='{"runAfterCreateDatabase":{"type":"Once"},"up":{"type":"Once"},"views":{"type":"AnyTime"},"sprocs":{"type":"AnyTime"},"permissions":{"type":"EveryTime"},"seed":{"type":"EveryTime"}}'

# 2. Run the backend API
dotnet run --project NamFix.Api      # https://localhost:7111

# 3. In a second terminal, run the front-end
dotnet run --project NamFix.Web      # https://localhost:7213
```

Then browse to the client's HTTPS URL (`https://localhost:7213`). Sample logins (password `Password123!`): `admin@namfix.na`,
`aqua@namfix.na`, `spark@namfix.na`, `auto@namfix.na`.

**Config:** `NamFix.Api/appsettings.json` holds `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection`, the `Jwt`
section, and `Cors:Origins`. The connection string is always taken from this file. Other settings
(e.g. the JWT signing key) may be overridden with a `NAMFIX_`-prefixed env var (double-underscore for
nesting), e.g. `NAMFIX_Jwt__SigningKey`.

---

## 9. Job requests (matching → booking) + realtime

A **`JobRequest`** is the single entity spanning the whole job lifecycle — matching, quoting,
booking, and payment. It is the **only** way money moves: a client can never pay an arbitrary
amount, only a completed job's invoice. (This entity was formerly `Booking`/`Bookings`; a
"booking" is just a job that has advanced past provider selection. Migration `up/0009` renames the
tables in place; stored status ints are preserved.)

- **Two entry points, one table** (`JobRequest.TargetMode`):
  - *Direct* — the client requests a specific provider with a first proposed time
    (`POST api/jobs/direct`), starting at `PendingProvider`.
  - *Broadcast / "get matched"* — the client posts a job (category, town, description, urgency) and
    the service fans it out to matching providers (`POST api/jobs`), starting at `Requested`. Urgent
    jobs target emergency-flagged, currently-available providers. Each invited provider gets a
    `JobRequestResponses` row (invitation → quote). The client accepts one quote
    (`accept-quote/{responseId}`), which sets the chosen provider **in place** and transitions the
    same row into the booking track.
- **Lifecycle** (`JobStatus`): `Requested`/`Quoted` (pre-provider) → `PendingProvider` ⇄
  `PendingClient` (time negotiation) → `Scheduled` → `InProgress` → `Completed` (invoice set) →
  `Paid` → `Reviewed`. Terminal off-ramps: `Cancelled`, `Declined`, `NoShow`. The whole state
  machine + authorization lives in `JobRequestService` (`IJobService`, `NamFix.Application`).
- **Payment**: `JobRequestService.PayAsync` is the only client payment path. It validates the job is
  `Completed`, then calls `TransactionService.CreateAsync` with the job's own `InvoiceAmount`
  (commission/hold-then-release as in §7) and links the resulting `TransactionId`.
- **Cancellation / no-show**: cancelling inside the admin-configured free window (default 24h before
  `ConfirmedStartUtc`, stored in `dbo.PlatformSettings`) flags a late cancellation and increments the
  canceller's counter (`Users`/`Providers.LateCancellationCount`). A no-show after the start time
  increments the absent party's `NoShowCount`.
- **Availability, rate cards, extended search**: providers publish weekly hours + time-off
  (`ProviderAvailabilityRules`/`ProviderTimeOff`, `GET api/providers/{id}/availability`) and a rate
  card (`ProviderRateCards`). Search gains price-range, years-experience, and response-time filters,
  backed by denormalized `Providers.StartingPrice`/`AvgResponseMinutes`.
- **Chat + location + invoice file**: each job has a message thread (`JobRequestMessages`), an
  optional client-shared location, and provider invoice / job-photo attachments
  (`JobRequestAttachments`, `Kind` discriminates), served via `GET/POST api/jobs/{id}/invoice`.
- **Notifications**: every job event writes a `Notifications` row (`JobRequestId`) for the affected
  party and is pushed live. The nav shows a 🔔 bell with unread count + dropdown (`NotificationsBell`).
- **Realtime (SignalR)**: `NotificationHub` (`/hubs/notifications`, **authenticated** — JWT in the
  query string, see `Program.cs` `OnMessageReceived`) puts each connection in a per-user group and is
  shared by jobs + support. `IJobRealtimeNotifier` (Shared.Contracts) decouples the service layer
  from SignalR; `SignalRJobNotifier` (API) implements it. The client `NotificationService` raises
  `BookingChanged` (wire event `JobChanged`) / `MessagePosted` so open views update live. Separate
  from the `StatusHub` heartbeat in §Connectivity.

## 10a. Email / mailing subsystem

Outgoing and incoming email, added alongside the in-app notification system.

- **One sender, `IMailSenderService`** (`NamFix.Application/Infrastructure/Mail`, MailKit/MimeKit over
  SMTP). `SendMailInBackground` is the Hangfire job entry point (`[AutomaticRetry(Attempts = 2)]`); the
  `SendMail` overloads send inline. Every failure is logged in full (Serilog) and rethrown so Hangfire
  retries — the request thread only ever *enqueues*, so a broken SMTP server never breaks an HTTP call.
- **Hangfire** (`Hangfire.SqlServer`, same DB, `[HangFire]` schema auto-created) runs background sends
  and a recurring `inbox-sync` job. Dashboard at `/hangfire` is **local-requests-only** (browser nav
  can't carry the JWT — see `HangfireDashboardAuthorizationFilter`).
- **Email for every notification**: `INotificationDispatcher` (`NamFix.Application/Services`) is the one
  choke point — it persists the `Notification`, enqueues a themed email, and returns the DTO the caller
  pushes over SignalR. Both `JobRequestService` and `SupportService` funnel `NotifyAsync` through it.
  Emails are rendered by `EmailTemplateRenderer` (inline CSS mirroring the `namfix.css` light palette).
- **Unsubscribe**: grouped `EmailNotificationCategory` (JobUpdates/Messages/Quotes/Support/
  AccountSecurity). Each `NotificationType` maps to one; `AccountSecurity` (password resets) always
  sends. Prefs live in `UserEmailPreferences`; footer links carry a stateless HMAC-signed token
  (`EmailPreferenceService`) so one-click unsubscribe (`GET api/email/unsubscribe`) needs no login.
  Managed on the client at `/settings/email`.
- **Password recovery**: `POST api/auth/forgot-password` (never reveals if the email exists) emails a
  single-use, expiring `PasswordResetTokens` link → `/reset-password?token=…` → `POST
  api/auth/reset-password` (revokes all refresh tokens). Client pages + a Login "Forgot password?" link.
- **Admin inbox**: the `inbox-sync` job reads the mailbox over POP3 (`Pop3MailReaderService`, deduped by
  message-id) into `InboxMessages`; admins read it at `/admin/inbox` (`api/admin/inbox`). Untrusted HTML
  bodies render inside a sandboxed iframe.
- **Config**: `MailConfiguration` (SMTP/POP, prefilled with **dummy** values) and `Mail`
  (ClientBaseUrl/ApiBaseUrl/SupportEmail/InboxPollMinutes/PasswordResetTokenHours) in
  `NamFix.Api/appsettings.json`. Schema in migration `up/0018_create_email_tables.sql`.
